# All About Capstone Projects

This repository contains a collection of web applications I am building to grow my skills as a Software Engineer while learning about problems that farmers in Kenya face and how I can use technology to try and help.

## Running the Apps

Each of the Apps has a README file that gives instructions on how to run it. Given the use of several tech stacks, there will be variations in how each of the apps is run locally. For example, a React only app will use `npm start` while a django focused app will use `python3 manage.py runserver`

I hope to deploy each of the apps for ease of access and to get practice on app deployment and learn how to deal with production changes. 

## Overview of the Apps
### Mkulima Project (Blogging App)
App that allows users to log in or create an account and write blogs. Users can also see the feed and any announcements if any. Users have the option to upload a profile picture for their blogpage.

### Farmer Weather (Current Weather App)
Farmer Weather is a django app that displays the weather of a given city on an interactive map. 

### Weather Prediction
This app allows users to get a 5 day forecast, see the history of weather for a given city in a given year and to get a 6 month forecast.
